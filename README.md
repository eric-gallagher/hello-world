# hello-world
Going through the motions, learning

I'm trying to figure out if I can use this for personal projects.  And also if I really want to share my personal, crappy projects with the entire world by default.

On the professional side of things, I think maybe my developers should be using this.  I've got that to think about, too.

Then there's the question of precisely what types of code can be saved.  I don't suppose there's a minecraft mods code pool here.  Trivial as that seems, it's something I could use to arouse friends' and family members' interests in GitHub.
